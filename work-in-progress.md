# Be inclusive in conversations

Avoid trying to be the complete center of attention in your conversations, its very tiring and allows you to do less.  You also tend to say the same things and so will learn less this way.

Opening up conversations is not always easy, especially if you have eager people asking questions, or shy people who dont want to come forward with questions in front of everyone.

However, encouraging others in the group to talk is a great way for everyone to learn more from the conversation.

## Ask for consensus

if you have a shy audience or one person dominating the conversation, try break open the discussion by asking if the current statement or discussion thread is what everyone generally agrees with (or dissagrees).

If you have different views, then its a great opportuntiy to ask someone else to share there thoughts.  Or if they are shy, play devils advocate and suggest alternative or contrarary opinions to what has been discussed on someone elses behalf.

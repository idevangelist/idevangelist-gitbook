# I, Devangelist

## Why write the book

The role of a devangelist can be very wide and vary significantly in the minds of those who work in the role, those who work with them and those that interact with them.  So this is my hopefully not to biased view on what a devangelist is all about and where I feel the role can add real value.

I will include stories, tips and common practices used to help make the devangelist role more effective 

## Code of Conduct Safe

A [Code of Conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct) is now used in most of the public events in the developer world.  It is a simple but important statement about respecting everyone during all interaction with other people, setting out expectations of a minimum level of positive behaviour towards each other.

You can of course be even nicer should you wish.

Example code of conduct documents include

* [Battlehack Code of Conduct](http://hackcodeofconduct.org/battlehack_london) by [@CBetta](https://twitter.com/cbetta) - for the Battlehack world wide hackathon events
* [Major League Hacking code of conduct] - worldwide student hacking organisation
* [SkillsMatter Code of Conduct](https://skillsmatter.com/go/code-of-conduct) for all their conferences & community events
* RubyGirls Code of Conduct
* [ClojureBridge] - helping the diverse developer community learn and love Clojure


## Applying Lean Principles & Agile Techniques

Many of the principles and practices I applied as an Agile Coach & developer are equally applicable to developer evangelism.  I will cover these principles and practices throughout the book with examples of how they can be effective. 

## Name of the book

As you may have already guessed the title of the book is a homage to the novel **I, Robot**.  I also subttle draw themes and concepts from the novel [I, Claudius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Claudius) by [Robert Graves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves).

## Geekiness throughout

Throughout the book I will also include many common (and possible a few obscure references) popular culture and science fiction works that many in the developer world relate to.  This is not just because I am geeky, but will hopefully help give a context feel less alien and help the reader relate to the concepts & practices covered.

## Audience for the book

This book shares all the experiences I can publicly share as a developer in the community and as a developer ambassador / advocate / evangelist.  Hopefully this will be useful to those:

  * currently working in an devangelist or community type role
  * looking to move into that role
  * wishing to hire a  devangelist team or their first devagelist or technical community focused role

This book is not about marketing or turning a developer into a marketeer.

My own personal view is that devangelists can benefit from marketing techniques to help them reach their audience more effectively, however they are only a complement to your main work.
